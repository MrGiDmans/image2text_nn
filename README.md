# Description of the Flickr8k-Images-Captions dataset
Link to the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aladdinpersson/flickr8kimagescaptions?resource=download)

An important fact is that the images presented in the dataset have a maximum size of 500 by 500 on each side.

I strongly recommend changing the "captions" file format from "txt" to "csv".
